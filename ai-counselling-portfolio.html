      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        AI-Counselling is a virtual mental-health companion that supports users across text chat, voice, and video.
        The system combines real-time emotion detection, speech-to-text, tone analysis, and retrieval-augmented
        generation (RAG) grounded in the DSM-5 to deliver supportive, empathetic responses. The frontend is built in
        Next.js with Clerk authentication and a personalized onboarding flow, while a FastAPI backend handles media
        processing and AI inference.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a data-science perspective, the product is a multimodal pipeline: audio and video streams are collected,
        cleaned, normalized, and converted into structured signals (transcripts, emotion labels, confidence scores),
        then fused with a retrieval layer that anchors the LLM to clinically relevant context.

      <h2>Problem and Goal</h2>
      <p>
        People often need immediate, low-friction emotional support before they are ready to seek professional help.
        This project focuses on creating a safe, accessible companion that listens, reflects, and offers practical
        guidance while remaining clear about its boundaries. It is designed to complement care and encourage users
        to seek licensed help when appropriate.
      </p>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Core User Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Users can choose a preferred mode (text, voice, or video) during onboarding. The experience adapts to their
        choice, while still using a consistent safety policy and a shared knowledge base.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Text:</strong> A chat interface that sends user messages to the backend and returns an empathetic response.</li>
        <li><strong>Voice:</strong> A voice recorder streams audio chunks to cloud storage and triggers speech processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Video:</strong> A video recorder captures facial expressions and integrates tone analysis and transcript context.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Onboarding and Personalization</h2>
      <p>
        The onboarding wizard collects high-level context such as age range, concerns, goals, cross-cutting symptoms,
        and preferences. This information is stored in MongoDB and used to tailor responses. The selected mode is
        saved to Clerk public metadata so the home experience loads the preferred interaction style by default.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Safety and Boundaries</h2>
      <p>
        A lightweight safety filter checks for high-risk language (for example, self-harm phrases) and provides an
        immediate supportive response. The system avoids providing medical advice and focuses on emotional support
        and grounding guidance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        The system uses a Next.js frontend connected to a FastAPI backend. Media is uploaded to Google Cloud Storage,
        and MongoDB stores user profiles and chat history. The backend performs emotion and tone analysis, speech
        transcription, and retrieval-augmented generation with the DSM-5.

    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</h2>
      <p>
        The DSM-5 is chunked into short passages and embedded with Sentence Transformers. These embeddings are stored
        in a FAISS index to enable fast similarity search. When a user sends a message or a transcript is generated,
        the backend retrieves the most relevant chunks and includes them in the prompt to Gemini. This keeps responses
        grounded in structured clinical context while remaining empathetic and user-friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chunking strategy uses fixed-size word windows (300 words per chunk). Embeddings are normalized and queried
        with cosine similarity via FAISS IndexFlatIP, returning the top-K (K=5) passages. This lightweight vector
        database avoids external services while enabling fast, in-memory semantic retrieval for each request.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Voice Analysis Pipeline</h2>
      <p>
        The voice flow records short audio chunks in the browser and uploads them to GCS. The backend downloads recent
        chunks, normalizes and cleans the audio, and performs speech emotion recognition using Wav2Vec2. The output is
        summarized into phases and distribution statistics, which are then used to shape the assistant's response.
      </p>
      <p>
        On ingestion, audio is resampled to 16 kHz mono, passed through high/low-pass filters (100 Hz–8 kHz), normalized,
        and compressed for dynamic range stability. The recognizer uses an ensemble strategy: each 1-second chunk is
        evaluated multiple times with a Wav2Vec2 emotion classifier, then aggregated with majority voting and confidence
        weighting. The pipeline yields emotion phases, total duration, and average confidence for downstream prompting.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Speech-to-Text</h2>
      <p>
        Audio is decoded robustly (with FFmpeg fallback), normalized, chunked, and sent to the Google speech API for
        transcription. The transcript is combined with RAG context and user profile data to generate a supportive
        response that reflects both content and tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The transcription path supports noisy, real-world audio by attempting tolerant decoding (FFmpeg) when direct
        parsing fails. Audio is chunked into 50-second segments to reduce API errors and improve recognition accuracy,
        then stitched into a single transcript for retrieval and response generation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Video Emotion Detection</h2>
      <p>
        Video recordings are processed server-side with OpenCV. Each frame is analyzed with DeepFace to detect
        dominant facial emotions. The final emotion is computed by majority vote. This signal, along with tone
        analysis and transcript context, informs the assistant's final reply.
      </p>
      <p>
        DeepFace runs per-frame inference with detection fallback disabled to avoid hard failures on low-quality frames.
        The system aggregates the per-frame labels into a dominant emotion using a simple frequency model, balancing
        robustness and latency for real-time feedback.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>LLM Prompting and Response Generation</h2>
      <p>
        The final response is composed from multiple signals: user text or transcript, detected facial emotion,
        Wav2Vec2 tone analysis, relevant DSM-5 retrieval chunks, and the user's onboarding profile. These inputs are
        injected into a structured prompt for Gemini to produce concise, empathetic guidance while respecting safety
        constraints and avoiding medical advice.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>POST /respond</code> - text chat response with RAG and chat history</li>
        <li><code>POST /detect_video_emotions</code> - video upload with facial emotion analysis</li>
        <li><code>GET /process_speech</code> - process recent voice chunks and return a final response</li>
        <li><code>POST /api/audio</code> - Next.js route to upload audio frames to GCS</li>
        <li><code>POST /api/uploadVideo</code> - Next.js helper route for media uploads</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Data and Storage</h2>
      <p>
        User profiles, onboarding data, and chat history are stored in MongoDB. Media assets (audio frames and video
        recordings) are stored in Google Cloud Storage with user-specific prefixes for isolation. This separation
        keeps application data structured while enabling scalable media processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chat history is queried for the most recent exchanges to provide short-term conversational memory, while
        questionnaire data supplies stable personalization signals. These sources are used alongside RAG to reduce
        hallucinations and keep responses grounded in user context.
      </p>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS, Clerk</li>
        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> FastAPI, Uvicorn, Python 3.12</li>
        <li><strong>AI/ML:</strong> Google Gemini, DeepFace, Wav2Vec2, Sentence Transformers, FAISS</li>
        <li><strong>Data:</strong> MongoDB Atlas, Google Cloud Storage</li>
        <li><strong>Audio:</strong> Librosa, Pydub, FFmpeg, SpeechRecognition</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The ML stack is intentionally modular: each modality (text, voice, video) produces interpretable intermediate
        outputs that can be logged, analyzed, and improved independently without rebuilding the entire system.
      </p>
